# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Configurable secret detection via `[secrets]` config section with `safe_patterns`, `extra_patterns`, and `value_heuristic` options
- Shannon entropy-based value heuristic replacing the simple length+alphanumeric check, reducing false positives on hostnames and URLs
- Built-in detection rules documented in configuration docs

### Fixed
- False positive in secret detection for long hostnames/URLs (e.g. `db-prod-ap-03.internal`)
- Diff view not refreshing visually after copy operations due to stale method value in Go value semantics
- Missing `(missing)` placeholder in compare view for added/removed keys
- `AddVar` not setting `IsSecret` on newly added variables

### Improved
- Deduplicated missing placeholder computation in diff entry rendering

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Config file search now uses current working directory instead of scan directory
